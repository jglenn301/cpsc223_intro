# cpsc223_intro
Some simple programs and examples of C type rules

`intro.c` is an example of output and single-character input

`bad_spacing.c` is the same as `intro.c` but formatted poorly, illustrating how spaces are mostly irrelevant to the C compiler.

`numbers.c` is an example of the imprecision of floating-point arithmetic

`gotchas.c` illustrates some C type rules and how misunderstanding them can lead to trouble
